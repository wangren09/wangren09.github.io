It is hard to summarize a general method in this category. Instead I will provide some insightful ideas for some of the problems.

## 1. Two Sum
<pre>
class Solution(object):
    
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if len(nums) <= 1:
            return False
        dict = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] in dict:
                return [dict[nums[i]],i]
            else:
                dict[target-nums[i]] = i
</pre>
Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n).

## 11. Container With Most Water
Idea: Set two pointers initialized at both ends of the array. Every time move the smaller value pointer to inner array. Then after the two pointers meet, all possible max cases have been scanned and the max situation is 100% reached somewhere in the scan.
<pre>
class Solution(object):
    
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        l = 0
        r = len(height)-1
        res = 0
        while l < r:
            res = max(res, min(height[l], height[r])*(r-l))
            if height[l] <= height[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        return res
</pre>
Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1).
