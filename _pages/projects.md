**Robust AI Guided by the Immune System**
------
[RAILS](https://github.com/wangren09/RAILS) We proposed a **new deep defense framework**, Robust Adversarial Immune-inspired Learning System (RAILS), by **emulating the immune system**.

**Robustness on Deep Non-Parametric Learning**
------
We generated a novel **Adversarial Soft kNN Attack**, which has **superior attack efficiency and accuracy degradation** relative to previous kNN-based attacks. We developed an **Adversarial Soft kNN Defense** that can **improve the robustness** of both kNN-based classifiers and DNNs.

**Results and Visualization:**

**Adversarial Meta-Learning**
------
[MetaAdv](https://github.com/wangren09/MetaAdv) We studied how adversarial robustness can be maintained in **few-shot learning** and proposed an **efficient adversarial few-shot learning method**.

**Backdoor Model Detection**
------
[TrojanNet](https://github.com/wangren09/TrojanNetDetector) We proposed **backdoor model detectors** that can effectively recognize **poisoned models** with the **corresponding backdoor triggers** under the **data-limited** and **data-free** regimes.

**Simultaneous Achievement of Data Privacy And Information Accuracy**
------
We developed a framework that can **protect data privacy** via adding noises and quantization. With some prior information, our method can effectively **recover** the original data in matrix/tensor forms with the **state-of-art guarantee** recovery guarantee. We further developed a **distributed algorithm** framework for **data recovery/clustering** tasks.

**Smart Grid Robustness and Uncertain Optimization with High-Penetration of Renewable Energy**
------
We proposed methods to **analyze the power grid robustness** and optimize the **economic dispatch** when considering highly stochastic renewable energy.

**Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Recurrent Neural Networks**
------
We implemented a recurrent neural network (LSTM) based on TensorFlow for the task of sentiment analysis on natural language data. Sentiment analysis refers to the natural language processing task of classifying some collection of the text by its polarity. We analyzed the data from Twitter ([Sentiment140 dataset](http://www.sentiment140.com/)) and try to classify it as either "positive" or "negative". The tweets can be viewed as sequences of words in natural language and form the sequantial input to the RNN model. The goal is to understand the attitude of the person that generates the text.
