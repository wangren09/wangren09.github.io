**Online Algorithm for PMU Data Processing (OLAP)**
------
We implemented OLAP by C# based on Project Alpha for the real-time application. Project Alpha is elite version of Open PDC. It provides a jump start to developing new products based on the Grid Solutions Framework's Time-Series Library (TSL) technology complete with all needed components for standalone time-series processing application. The code developed on Project Alpha can be run on Open PDC as action adapter.
