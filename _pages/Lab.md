# Trustworthy and Intelligent Machine Learning (TIML) Research Lab

The Trustworthy and Intelligent Machine Learning Research Lab is an innovative research laboratory dedicated to building next-generation trustworthy and intelligent machine learning systems for accelerating engineering and scientific discovery. The lab's research activities are centered around two key themes: (1) Foundations of Trustworthy and Intelligent Machine Learning and (2) Trustworthy and Intelligent Machine Learning for Engineering and Science. The Foundations of Trustworthy and Intelligent Machine Learning theme explores issues such as robustness, interpretability, transparency, privacy, and security in machine learning systems. This research theme aims to develop tools and techniques that enable the design and implementation of performance-optimized machine learning systems that can be trusted by end-users, regulators, and other stakeholders. The Trustworthy and Intelligent Machine Learning for Engineering and Science theme, on the other hand, focuses on the development of intelligent machine learning systems that enable the reliable and efficient development of engineering and science methodologies, tools, and practices. The lab's research outcomes are expected to have significant impacts on various domains, such as machine learning, computer vision, biology, healthcare, power systems, control, and education.
