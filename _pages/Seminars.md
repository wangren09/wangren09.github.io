**Title**: Flexible and Faithful Federated Learning and Unlearning Methods

**Abstract**: Federated learning enables machine learning algorithms to be trained over decentralized edge devices without requiring the exchange of local datasets. We consider two scenarios in this talk. In the first scenario, we have cooperative agents running distributed optimization methods. Current literature fail to capture the heterogeneity in agents’ local computation capacities. We propose FedHybrid as a hybrid primal-dual method that allows heterogeneous agents to perform a mixture of first and second order updates.  We prove that FedHybrid converges linearly to the exact optimal point for strongly convex functions. In the second scenario, we consider strategic agents with different data distributions. We analyze how the distribution of data affects agents' incentives to voluntarily participate and obediently follow traditional federated learning algorithms. We design a Faithful Federated Learning (FFL) mechanism based on FedAvg method and VCG mechanism which achieves (probably approximate) optimality, faithful implementation, voluntary participation, and balanced budget. Lastly, we analyze an alternative approach to align individual agent’s incentive to participate by allowing unlearning option. We propose a multi-stage game theoretic framework and study the equilibrium properties.
