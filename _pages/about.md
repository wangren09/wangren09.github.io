I am a Ph.D candidate in Electrical Engineering at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Insititute (RPI)](http://rpi.edu/), department of ECSE under [Prof. Meng Wang](https://ecse.rpi.edu/~wang/). I completed my M.S. at [University of Pennsylvania (Penn)](http://www.upenn.edu/), and received my B.S. in Electronic and Information Engineering from [Xidian University](http://www.xidian.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in the intersection of the fields of signal processing, high-dimensional statistics, and machine learning.
