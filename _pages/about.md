**Short Bio**
------
Ren Wang was a postdoctoral research fellow (and a lecturer) in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). He received his Ph.D degree from [the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering](https://www.ecse.rpi.edu) at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu). He received both his bachelor's degree and master's degree in Electrical Engineering in 2013 and 2016 from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). His research interests include Trustworthy Machine Learning, High-Dimensional Data Analysis, Bio-Inspired Machine Learning, and Smart Grid (see research lab intro [here](https://wangren09.github.io/projects/)).
